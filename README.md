# Data Structures in C

This repository contains C implementations of fundamental data structures, including:

- **Array**: A linear data structure that stores elements contiguously in memory, enabling fast access by index.

- **Linked List**: A data structure where each element is a node containing a value and a reference to the next node, facilitating sequential access.

- **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, allowing elements to be added and removed only from one end.

- **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, supporting element addition at the rear and removal from the front.

- **Heap**: A binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, commonly used to implement a priority queue.

- **Hashmap**: A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function, enabling constant-time access on average.

## Contents

Each data structure is implemented in a separate source file and accompanied by usage examples in the `main.c` file. To use these structures in your project, include the corresponding header files in your source code and integrate them as needed.
