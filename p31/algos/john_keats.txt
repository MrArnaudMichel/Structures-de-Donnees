O Goddess hear these tuneless numbers wrung
By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear
And pardon that thy secrets should be sung
Even into thine own soft-conched ear
Surely I dreamt to-day or did I see
The winged Psyche with awaken’d eyes
I wander’d in a forest thoughtlessly
And on the sudden fainting with surprise
Saw two fair creatures couched side by side
In deepest grass beneath the whisp’ring roof
Of leaves and trembled blossoms where there ran
A brooklet scarce espied
Mid hush’d cool-rooted flowers fragrant-eyed
Blue silver-white and budded Tyrian
They lay calm-breathing on the bedded grass
Their arms embraced and their pinions too
Their lips touch’d not but had not bade adieu
As if disjoined by soft-handed slumber
And ready still past kisses to outnumber
At tender eye-dawn of aurorean love
The winged boy I knew
But who wast thou O happy happy dove
His Psyche true
O latest born and loveliest vision far
Of all Olympus’ faded hierarchy
Fairer than Phoebe’s sapphire-region’d star
Or Vesper amorous glow-worm of the sky
Fairer than these though temple thou hast none
Nor altar heap’d with flowers
Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan
Upon the midnight hours
No voice no lute no pipe no incense sweet
From chain-swung censer teeming
No shrine no grove no oracle no heat
Of pale-mouth’d prophet dreaming
O brightest though too late for antique vows
Too too late for the fond believing lyre
When holy were the haunted forest boughs
Holy the air the water and the fire
Yet even in these days so far retir’d
From happy pieties thy lucent fans
Fluttering among the faint Olympians
I see and sing by my own eyes inspir’d
So let me be thy choir and make a moan
Upon the midnight hours
Thy voice thy lute thy pipe thy incense sweet
From swinged censer teeming
Thy shrine thy grove thy oracle thy heat
Of pale-mouth’d prophet dreaming
Yes I will be thy priest and build a fane
In some untrodden region of my mind
Where branched thoughts new grown with pleasant pain
Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind
Far far around shall those dark-cluster’d trees
Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep
And there by zephyrs streams and birds and bees
The moss-lain Dryads shall be lull’d to sleep
And in the midst of this wide quietness
A rosy sanctuary will I dress
With the wreath’d trellis of a working brain
With buds and bells and stars without a name
With all the gardener Fancy e’er could feign
Who breeding flowers will never breed the same
And there shall be for thee all soft delight
That shadowy thought can win
A bright torch and a casement ope at night
To let the warm Love in
No no go not to Lethe neither twist
Wolf's-bane tight-rooted for its poisonous wine
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd
By nightshade ruby grape of Proserpine
Make not your rosary of yew-berries
Nor let the beetle nor the death-moth be
Your mournful Psyche nor the downy owl
A partner in your sorrow's mysteries
For shade to shade will come too drowsily
And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul
But when the melancholy fit shall fall
Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud
That fosters the droop-headed flowers all
And hides the green hill in an April shroud
Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose
Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave
Or on the wealth of globed peonies
Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows
Emprison her soft hand and let her rave
And feed deep deep upon her peerless eyes
She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die
And Joy whose hand is ever at his lips
Bidding adieu and aching Pleasure nigh
Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips
Ay in the very temple of Delight
Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine
Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine
His soul shalt taste the sadness of her might
And be among her cloudy trophies hung
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core
To swell the gourd and plump the hazel shells
With a sweet kernel to set budding more
And still more later flowers for the bees
Until they think warm days will never cease
For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor
Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind
Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep
Drows'd with the fume of poppies while thy hook
Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
Steady thy laden head across a brook
Or by a cyder-press with patient look
Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours
Where are the songs of spring Ay Where are they
Think not of them thou hast thy music too—
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
Among the river sallows borne aloft
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn
Hedge-crickets sing and now with treble soft
The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft
And gathering swallows twitter in the skies
Bright star would I were stedfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching with eternal lids apart
Like nature's patient sleepless Eremite
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors—
No—yet still stedfast still unchangeable
Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest
Still still to hear her tender-taken breath
And so live ever—or else swoon to death
Ever let the Fancy roam
Pleasure never is at home
At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth
Like to bubbles when rain pelteth
Then let winged Fancy wander
Through the thought still spread beyond her
Open wide the mind's cage-door
She'll dart forth and cloudward soar
O sweet Fancy let her loose
Summer's joys are spoilt by use
And the enjoying of the Spring
Fades as does its blossoming
Autumn's red-lipp'd fruitage too
Blushing through the mist and dew
Cloys with tasting What do then
Sit thee by the ingle when
The sear faggot blazes bright
Spirit of a winter's night
When the soundless earth is muffled
And the caked snow is shuffled
From the ploughboy's heavy shoon
When the Night doth meet the Noon
In a dark conspiracy
To banish Even from her sky
Sit thee there and send abroad
With a mind self-overaw'd
Fancy high-commission'd—send her
She has vassals to attend her
She will bring in spite of frost
Beauties that the earth hath lost
She will bring thee all together
All delights of summer weather
All the buds and bells of May
From dewy sward or thorny spray
All the heaped Autumn's wealth
With a still mysterious stealth
She will mix these pleasures up
Like three fit wines in a cup
And thou shalt quaff it—thou shalt hear
Distant harvest-carols clear
Rustle of the reaped corn
Sweet birds antheming the morn
And in the same moment—hark
'Tis the early April lark
Or the rooks with busy caw
Foraging for sticks and straw
Thou shalt at one glance behold
The daisy and the marigold
White-plum'd lilies and the first
Hedge-grown primrose that hath burst
Shaded hyacinth alway
Sapphire queen of the mid-May
And every leaf and every flower
Pearled with the self-same shower
Thou shalt see the field-mouse peep
Meagre from its celled sleep
And the snake all winter-thin
Cast on sunny bank its skin
Freckled nest-eggs thou shalt see
Hatching in the hawthorn-tree
When the hen-bird's wing doth rest
Quiet on her mossy nest
Then the hurry and alarm
When the bee-hive casts its swarm
Acorns ripe down-pattering
While the autumn breezes sing
Oh sweet Fancy let her loose
Every thing is spoilt by use
Where's the cheek that doth not fade
Too much gaz'd at Where's the maid
Whose lip mature is ever new
Where's the eye however blue
Doth not weary Where's the face
One would meet in every place
Where's the voice however soft
One would hear so very oft
At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth
Like to bubbles when rain pelteth
Let then winged Fancy find
Thee a mistress to thy mind
Dulcet-eyed as Ceres' daughter
Ere the God of Torment taught her
How to frown and how to chide
With a waist and with a side
White as Hebe's when her zone
Slipt its golden clasp and down
Fell her kirtle to her feet
While she held the goblet sweet
And Jove grew languid—Break the mesh
Of the Fancy's silken leash
Quickly break her prison-string
And such joys as these she'll bring—
Let the winged Fancy roam
Pleasure never is at home
Byron how sweetly sad thy melody
Attuning still the soul to tenderness
As if soft Pity with unusual stress
Had touch’d her plaintive lute and thou being by
Hadst caught the tones nor suffer’d them to die
O’ershadowing sorrow doth not make thee less
Delightful thou thy griefs dost dress
With a bright halo shining beamily
As when a cloud the golden moon doth veil
Its sides are ting’d with a resplendent glow
Through the dark robe oft amber rays prevail
And like fair veins in sable marble flow
Still warble dying swan still tell the tale
The enchanting tale the tale of pleasing woe
Thou still unravish’d bride of quietness
Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time
Sylvan historian who canst thus express
A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme
What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape
Of deities or mortals or of both
In Tempe or the dales of Arcady
What men or gods are these what maidens loath
What mad pursuit What struggle to escape
What pipes and timbrels What wild ecstasy
Heard melodies are sweet but those unheard
Are sweeter therefore ye soft pipes play on
Not to the sensual ear but more endear’d
Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone
Fair youth beneath the trees thou canst not leave
Thy song nor ever can those trees be bare
Bold Lover never never canst thou kiss
Though winning near the goal—yet do not grieve
She cannot fade though thou hast not thy bliss
Forever wilt thou love and she be fair
Ah happy happy boughs that cannot shed
Your leaves nor ever bid the Spring adieu
And happy melodist unwearied
For ever piping songs for ever new
More happy love more happy happy love
For ever warm and still to be enjoy’d
For ever panting and for ever young
All breathing human passion far above
That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy’d
A burning forehead and a parching tongue
Who are these coming to the sacrifice
To what green altar O mysterious priest
Lead’st thou that heifer lowing at the skies
And all her silken flanks with garlands drest
What little town by river or sea shore
Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel
Is emptied of this folk this pious morn
And little town thy streets for evermore
Will silent be and not a soul to tell
Why thou art desolate can e’er return
O Attic shape Fair attitude with brede
Of marble men and maidens overwrought
With forest branches and the trodden weed
Thou silent form dost tease us out of thought
As doth eternity Cold Pastoral
When old age shall this generation waste
Thou shalt remain in midst of other woe
Than ours a friend to man to whom thou say’st
Beauty is truth truth beauty that is all
Ye know on earth and all ye need to know
O what can ail thee knight-at-arms
Alone and palely loitering
The sedge has withered from the lake
And no birds sing
O what can ail thee knight-at-arms
So haggard and so woe-begone
The squirrel’s granary is full
And the harvest’s done
I see a lily on thy brow
With anguish moist and fever-dew
And on thy cheeks a fading rose
Fast withereth too
I met a lady in the meads
Full beautiful—a faery’s child
Her hair was long her foot was light
And her eyes were wild
I made a garland for her head
And bracelets too and fragrant zone
She looked at me as she did love
And made sweet moan
O soft embalmer of the still midnight
Shutting with careful fingers and benign
Our gloom-pleas’d eyes embower’d from the light
Enshaded in forgetfulness divine
O soothest Sleep if so it please thee close
In midst of this thine hymn my willing eyes
Or wait the “Amen” ere thy poppy throws
Around my bed its lulling charities
Then save me or the passed day will shine
Upon my pillow breeding many woes—
Save me from curious Conscience that still lords
Its strength for darkness burrowing like a mole
Turn the key deftly in the oiled wards
And seal the hushed Casket of my Soul
My heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains
My sense as though of hemlock I had drunk
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
One minute past and Lethe-wards had sunk
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot
But being too happy in thine happiness—
That thou light-winged Dryad of the trees
In some melodious plot
Of beechen green and shadows numberless
Singest of summer in full-throated ease
O for a draught of vintage that hath been
Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth
Tasting of Flora and the country green
Dance and Provençal song and sunburnt mirth
O for a beaker full of the warm South
Full of the true the blushful Hippocrene
With beaded bubbles winking at the brim
And purple-stained mouth
That I might drink and leave the world unseen
And with thee fade away into the forest dim
Fade far away dissolve and quite forget
What thou among the leaves hast never known
The weariness the fever and the fret
Here where men sit and hear each other groan
Where palsy shakes a few sad last gray hairs
Where youth grows pale and spectre-thin and dies
Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
And leaden-eyed despairs
Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes
Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow
Away away for I will fly to thee
Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards
But on the viewless wings of Poesy
Though the dull brain perplexes and retards
Already with thee tender is the night
And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne
Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays
But here there is no light
Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways
I cannot see what flowers are at my feet
Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs
But in embalmed darkness guess each sweet
Wherewith the seasonable month endows
The grass the thicket and the fruit-tree wild
White hawthorn and the pastoral eglantine
Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves
And mid-May's eldest child
The coming musk-rose full of dewy wine
The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves
Darkling I listen and for many a time
I have been half in love with easeful Death
Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme
To take into the air my quiet breath
Now more than ever seems it rich to die
To cease upon the midnight with no pain
While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
In such an ecstasy
Still wouldst thou sing and I have ears in vain—
To thy high requiem become a sod
Thou wast not born for death immortal Bird
No hungry generations tread thee down
The voice I hear this passing night was heard
In ancient days by emperor and clown
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
Through the sad heart of Ruth when sick for home
She stood in tears amid the alien corn
The same that oft-times hath
Charm'd magic casements opening on the foam
Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn
Forlorn the very word is like a bell
To toll me back from thee to my sole self
Adieu the fancy cannot cheat so well
As she is fam'd to do deceiving elf
Adieu adieu thy plaintive anthem fades
Past the near meadows over the still stream
Up the hill-side and now 'tis buried deep
In the next valley-glades
Was it a vision or a waking dream
Fled is that music Do I wake or sleep

Upon a time before the faery broods
Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods
Before King Oberon's bright diadem
Sceptre and mantle clasp'd with dewy gem
Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns
From rushes green and brakes and cowslip'd lawns
The ever-smitten Hermes empty left
His golden throne bent warm on amorous theft
From high Olympus had he stolen light
On this side of Jove's clouds to escape the sight
Of his great summoner and made retreat
Into a forest on the shores of Crete
For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt
A nymph to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt
At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured
Pearls while on land they wither'd and adored
Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont
And in those meads where sometime she might haunt
Were strewn rich gifts unknown to any Muse
Though Fancy's casket were unlock'd to choose
Ah what a world of love was at her feet
So Hermes thought and a celestial heat
Burnt from his winged heels to either ear
That from a whiteness as the lily clear
Blush'd into roses 'mid his golden hair
Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare
From vale to vale from wood to wood he flew
Breathing upon the flowers his passion new
And wound with many a river to its head
To find where this sweet nymph prepar'd her secret bed
In vain the sweet nymph might nowhere be found
And so he rested on the lonely ground
Pensive and full of painful jealousies
Of the Wood-Gods and even the very trees
There as he stood he heard a mournful voice
Such as once heard in gentle heart destroys
All pain but pity thus the lone voice spake
When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake
When move in a sweet body fit for life
And love and pleasure and the ruddy strife
Of hearts and lips Ah miserable me
The God dove-footed glided silently
Round bush and tree soft-brushing in his speed
The taller grasses and full-flowering weed
Until he found a palpitating snake
Bright and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake
She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue
Vermilion-spotted golden green and blue
Striped like a zebra freckled like a pard
Eyed like a peacock and all crimson barr'd
And full of silver moons that as she breathed
Dissolv'd or brighter shone or interwreathed
Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries—
So rainbow-sided touch'd with miseries
She seem'd at once some penanced lady elf
Some demon's mistress or the demon's self
Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire
Sprinkled with stars like Ariadne's tiar
Her head was serpent but ah bitter-sweet
She had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete
And for her eyes what could such eyes do there
But weep and weep that they were born so fair
As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air
Her throat was serpent but the words she spake
Came as through bubbling honey for Love's sake
And thus while Hermes on his pinions lay
Like a stoop'd falcon ere he takes his prey
Fair Hermes crown'd with feathers fluttering light
I had a splendid dream of thee last night
I saw thee sitting on a throne of gold
Among the Gods upon Olympus old
The only sad one for thou didst not hear
The soft lute-finger'd Muses chaunting clear
Nor even Apollo when he sang alone
Deaf to his throbbing throat's long long melodious moan
I dreamt I saw thee robed in purple flakes
Break amorous through the clouds as morning breaks
And swiftly as a bright Phœbean dart
Strike for the Cretan isle and here thou art
Too gentle Hermes hast thou found the maid
Whereat the star of Lethe not delay'd
His rosy eloquence and thus inquired
Thou smooth-lipp'd serpent surely high inspired
Thou beauteous wreath with melancholy eyes
Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise
Telling me only where my nymph is fled—
Where she doth breathe Bright planet thou hast said
Return'd the snake but seal with oaths fair God
I swear said Hermes by my serpent rod
And by thine eyes and by thy starry crown
Light flew his earnest words among the blossoms blown
Then thus again the brilliance feminine
Too frail of heart for this lost nymph of thine
Free as the air invisibly she strays
About these thornless wilds her pleasant days
She tastes unseen unseen her nimble feet
Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet
From weary tendrils and bow'd branches green
She plucks the fruit unseen she bathes unseen
And by my power is her beauty veil'd
To keep it unaffronted unassail'd
By the love-glances of unlovely eyes
Of Satyrs Fauns and blear'd Silenus' sighs
Pale grew her immortality for woe
Of all these lovers and she grieved so
I took compassion on her bade her steep
Her hair in weird syrops that would keep
Her loveliness invisible yet free
To wander as she loves in liberty
Thou shalt behold her Hermes thou alone
If thou wilt as thou swearest grant my boon
Then once again the charmed God began
An oath and through the serpent's ears it ran
Warm tremulous devout psalterian
Ravish'd she lifted her Circean head
Blush'd a live damask and swift-lisping said
I was a woman let me have once more
A woman's shape and charming as before
I love a youth of Corinth—O the bliss
Give me my woman's form and place me where he is
Stoop Hermes let me breathe upon thy brow
And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now
The God on half-shut feathers sank serene
She breath'd upon his eyes and swift was seen
Of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green
It was no dream or say a dream it was
Real are the dreams of Gods and smoothly pass
Their pleasures in a long immortal dream
One warm flush'd moment hovering it might seem
Dash'd by the wood-nymph's beauty so he burn'd
Then lighting on the printless verdure turn'd
To the swoon'd serpent and with languid arm
Delicate put to proof the lythe Caducean charm
So done upon the nymph his eyes he bent
Full of adoring tears and blandishment
And towards her stept she like a moon in wane
Faded before him cower'd nor could restrain
Her fearful sobs self-folding like a flower
That faints into itself at evening hour
But the God fostering her chilled hand
She felt the warmth her eyelids open'd bland
And like new flowers at morning song of bees
Bloom'd and gave up her honey to the lees
Into the green-recessed woods they flew
Nor grew they pale as mortal lovers do
Left to herself the serpent now began
To change her elfin blood in madness ran
Her mouth foam'd and the grass therewith besprent
Wither'd at dew so sweet and virulent
Her eyes in torture fix'd and anguish drear
Hot glaz'd and wide with lid-lashes all sear
Flash'd phosphor and sharp sparks without one cooling tear
The colours all inflam'd throughout her train
She writh'd about convuls'd with scarlet pain
A deep volcanian yellow took the place
Of all her milder-mooned body's grace
And as the lava ravishes the mead
Spoilt all her silver mail and golden brede
Made gloom of all her frecklings streaks and bars
Eclips'd her crescents and lick'd up her stars
So that in moments few she was undrest
Of all her sapphires greens and amethyst
And rubious-argent of all these bereft
Nothing but pain and ugliness were left
Still shone her crown that vanish'd also she
Melted and disappear'd as suddenly
And in the air her new voice luting soft
Cried Lycius gentle Lycius—Borne aloft
With the bright mists about the mountains hoar
These words dissolv'd Crete's forests heard no more
Whither fled Lamia now a lady bright
A full-born beauty new and exquisite
She fled into that valley they pass o'er
Who go to Corinth from Cenchreas' shore
And rested at the foot of those wild hills
The rugged founts of the Peræan rills
And of that other ridge whose barren back
Stretches with all its mist and cloudy rack
South-westward to Cleone There she stood
About a young bird's flutter from a wood
Fair on a sloping green of mossy tread
By a clear pool wherein she passioned
To see herself escap'd from so sore ills
While her robes flaunted with the daffodils
Ah happy Lycius—for she was a maid
More beautiful than ever twisted braid
Or sigh'd or blush'd or on spring-flowered lea
Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy
A virgin purest lipp'd yet in the lore
Of love deep learned to the red heart's core
Not one hour old yet of sciential brain
To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain
Define their pettish limits and estrange
Their points of contact and swift counterchange
Intrigue with the specious chaos and dispart
Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art
As though in Cupid's college she had spent
Sweet days a lovely graduate still unshent
And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment
Why this fair creature chose so fairily
By the wayside to linger we shall see
But first 'tis fit to tell how she could muse
And dream when in the serpent prison-house
Of all she list strange or magnificent
How ever where she will'd her spirit went
Whether to faint Elysium or where
Down through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair
Wind into Thetis' bower by many a pearly stair
Or where God Bacchus drains his cups divine
Stretch'd out at ease beneath a glutinous pine
Or where in Pluto's gardens palatine
Mulciber's columns gleam in far piazzian line
And sometimes into cities she would send
Her dream with feast and rioting to blend
And once while among mortals dreaming thus
She saw the young Corinthian Lycius
Charioting foremost in the envious race
Like a young Jove with calm uneager face
And fell into a swooning love of him
Now on the moth-time of that evening dim
He would return that way as well she knew
To Corinth from the shore for freshly blew
The eastern soft wind and his galley now
Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow
In port Cenchreas from Egina isle
Fresh anchor'd whither he had been awhile
To sacrifice to Jove whose temple there
Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare
Jove heard his vows and better'd his desire
For by some freakful chance he made retire
From his companions and set forth to walk
Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk
Over the solitary hills he fared
Thoughtless at first but ere eve's star appeared
His phantasy was lost where reason fades
In the calm'd twilight of Platonic shades
Lamia beheld him coming near more near—
Close to her passing in indifference drear
His silent sandals swept the mossy green
So neighbour'd to him and yet so unseen
She stood he pass'd shut up in mysteries
His mind wrapp'd like his mantle while her eyes
Follow'd his steps and her neck regal white
Turn'd—syllabling thus Ah Lycius bright
And will you leave me on the hills alone
Lycius look back and be some pity shown
He did not with cold wonder fearingly
But Orpheus-like at an Eurydice
For so delicious were the words she sung
It seem'd he had lov'd them a whole summer long
And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up
Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup
And still the cup was full—while he afraid
Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid
Due adoration thus began to adore
Her soft look growing coy she saw his chain so sure
Leave thee alone Look back Ah Goddess see
Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee
For pity do not this sad heart belie—
Even as thou vanishest so I shall die
Stay though a Naiad of the rivers stay
To thy far wishes will thy streams obey
Stay though the greenest woods be thy domain
Alone they can drink up the morning rain
Though a descended Pleiad will not one
Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune
Thy spheres and as thy silver proxy shine
So sweetly to these ravish'd ears of mine
Came thy sweet greeting that if thou shouldst fade
Thy memory will waste me to a shade—
For pity do not melt—If I should stay
Said Lamia here upon this floor of clay
And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough
What canst thou say or do of charm enough
To dull the nice remembrance of my home
Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam
Over these hills and vales where no joy is—
Empty of immortality and bliss
Thou art a scholar Lycius and must know
That finer spirits cannot breathe below
In human climes and live Alas poor youth
What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe
My essence What serener palaces
Where I may all my many senses please
And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease
It cannot be—Adieu So said she rose
Tiptoe with white arms spread He sick to lose
The amorous promise of her lone complain
Swoon'd murmuring of love and pale with pain
The cruel lady without any show
Of sorrow for her tender favourite's woe
But rather if her eyes could brighter be
With brighter eyes and slow amenity
Put her new lips to his and gave afresh
The life she had so tangled in her mesh
And as he from one trance was wakening
Into another she began to sing
Happy in beauty life and love and every thing
A song of love too sweet for earthly lyres
While like held breath the stars drew in their panting fires
And then she whisper'd in such trembling tone
As those who safe together met alone
For the first time through many anguish'd days
Use other speech than looks bidding him raise
His drooping head and clear his soul of doubt
For that she was a woman and without
Any more subtle fluid in her veins
Than throbbing blood and that the self-same pains
Inhabited her frail-strung heart as his
And next she wonder'd how his eyes could miss
Her face so long in Corinth where she said
She dwelt but half retir'd and there had led
Days happy as the gold coin could invent
Without the aid of love yet in content
Till she saw him as once she pass'd him by
Where 'gainst a column he leant thoughtfully
At Venus' temple porch 'mid baskets heap'd
Of amorous herbs and flowers newly reap'd
Late on that eve as 'twas the night before
The Adonian feast whereof she saw no more
But wept alone those days for why should she adore
Lycius from death awoke into amaze
To see her still and singing so sweet lays
Then from amaze into delight he fell
To hear her whisper woman's lore so well
And every word she spake entic'd him on
To unperplex'd delight and pleasure known
Let the mad poets say whate'er they please
Of the sweets of Fairies Peris Goddesses
There is not such a treat among them all
Haunters of cavern lake and waterfall
As a real woman lineal indeed
From Pyrrha's pebbles or old Adam's seed
Thus gentle Lamia judg'd and judg'd aright
That Lycius could not love in half a fright
So threw the goddess off and won his heart
More pleasantly by playing woman's part
With no more awe than what her beauty gave
That while it smote still guaranteed to save
Lycius to all made eloquent reply
Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh
And last pointing to Corinth ask'd her sweet
If 'twas too far that night for her soft feet
The way was short for Lamia's eagerness
Made by a spell the triple league decrease
To a few paces not at all surmised
By blinded Lycius so in her comprized
They pass'd the city gates he knew not how
So noiseless and he never thought to know
As men talk in a dream so Corinth all
Throughout her palaces imperial
And all her populous streets and temples lewd
Mutter'd like tempest in the distance brew'd
To the wide-spreaded night above her towers
Men women rich and poor in the cool hours
Shuffled their sandals o'er the pavement white
Companion'd or alone while many a light
Flared here and there from wealthy festivals
And threw their moving shadows on the walls
Or found them cluster'd in the corniced shade
Of some arch'd temple door or dusky colonnade
Muffling his face of greeting friends in fear
Her fingers he press'd hard as one came near
With curl'd gray beard sharp eyes and smooth bald crown
Slow-stepp'd and robed in philosophic gown
Lycius shrank closer as they met and past
Into his mantle adding wings to haste
While hurried Lamia trembled Ah said he
Why do you shudder love so ruefully
Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew—
I'm wearied said fair Lamia tell me who
Is that old man I cannot bring to mind
His features—Lycius wherefore did you blind
Yourself from his quick eyes Lycius replied
'Tis Apollonius sage my trusty guide
And good instructor but to-night he seems
The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams
While yet he spake they had arrived before
A pillar'd porch with lofty portal door
Where hung a silver lamp whose phosphor glow
Reflected in the slabbed steps below
Mild as a star in water for so new
And so unsullied was the marble hue
So through the crystal polish liquid fine
Ran the dark veins that none but feet divine
Could e'er have touch'd there Sounds Æolian
Breath'd from the hinges as the ample span
Of the wide doors disclos'd a place unknown
Some time to any but those two alone
And a few Persian mutes who that same year
Were seen about the markets none knew where
They could inhabit the most curious
Were foil'd who watch'd to trace them to their house
And but the flitter-winged verse must tell
For truth's sake what woe afterwards befel
'Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus
Shut from the busy world of more incredulous
Love in a hut with water and a crust
Is—Love forgive us—cinders ashes dust
Love in a palace is perhaps at last
More grievous torment than a hermit's fast—
That is a doubtful tale from faery land
Hard for the non-elect to understand
Had Lycius liv'd to hand his story down
He might have given the moral a fresh frown
Or clench'd it quite but too short was their bliss
To breed distrust and hate that make the soft voice hiss
Besides there nightly with terrific glare
Love jealous grown of so complete a pair
Hover'd and buzz'd his wings with fearful roar
Above the lintel of their chamber door
And down the passage cast a glow upon the floor
For all this came a ruin side by side
They were enthroned in the even tide
Upon a couch near to a curtaining
Whose airy texture from a golden string
Floated into the room and let appear
Unveil'd the summer heaven blue and clear
Betwixt two marble shafts—there they reposed
Where use had made it sweet with eyelids closed
Saving a tythe which love still open kept
That they might see each other while they almost slept
When from the slope side of a suburb hill
Deafening the swallow's twitter came a thrill
Of trumpets—Lycius started—the sounds fled
But left a thought a buzzing in his head
For the first time since first he harbour'd in
That purple-lined palace of sweet sin
His spirit pass'd beyond its golden bourn
Into the noisy world almost forsworn
The lady ever watchful penetrant
Saw this with pain so arguing a want
Of something more more than her empery
Of joys and she began to moan and sigh
Because he mused beyond her knowing well
That but a moment's thought is passion's passing bell
Why do you sigh fair creature whisper'd he
Why do you think return'd she tenderly
You have deserted me—where am I now
Not in your heart while care weighs on your brow
No no you have dismiss'd me and I go
From your breast houseless ay it must be so
He answer'd bending to her open eyes
Where he was mirror'd small in paradise
My silver planet both of eve and morn
Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn
While I am striving how to fill my heart
With deeper crimson and a double smart
How to entangle trammel up and snare
Your soul in mine and labyrinth you there
Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose
Ay a sweet kiss—you see your mighty woes
My thoughts shall I unveil them Listen then
What mortal hath a prize that other men
May be confounded and abash'd withal
But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical
And triumph as in thee I should rejoice
Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth's voice
Let my foes choke and my friends shout afar
While through the thronged streets your bridal car
Wheels round its dazzling spokes—The lady's cheek
Trembled she nothing said but pale and meek
Arose and knelt before him wept a rain
Of sorrows at his words at last with pain
Beseeching him the while his hand she wrung
To change his purpose He thereat was stung
Perverse with stronger fancy to reclaim
Her wild and timid nature to his aim
Besides for all his love in self despite
Against his better self he took delight
Luxurious in her sorrows soft and new
His passion cruel grown took on a hue
Fierce and sanguineous as 'twas possible
In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell
Fine was the mitigated fury like
Apollo's presence when in act to strike
The serpent—Ha the serpent certes she
Was none She burnt she lov'd the tyranny
And all subdued consented to the hour
When to the bridal he should lead his paramour
Whispering in midnight silence said the youth
Sure some sweet name thou hast though by my truth
I have not ask'd it ever thinking thee
Not mortal but of heavenly progeny
As still I do Hast any mortal name
Fit appellation for this dazzling frame
Or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth
To share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth
I have no friends said Lamia no not one
My presence in wide Corinth hardly known
My parents' bones are in their dusty urns
Sepulchred where no kindled incense burns
Seeing all their luckless race are dead save me
And I neglect the holy rite for thee
Even as you list invite your many guests
But if as now it seems your vision rests
With any pleasure on me do not bid
Old Apollonius—from him keep me hid
Lycius perplex'd at words so blind and blank
Made close inquiry from whose touch she shrank
Feigning a sleep and he to the dull shade
Of deep sleep in a moment was betray'd
It was the custom then to bring away
The bride from home at blushing shut of day
Veil'd in a chariot heralded along
By strewn flowers torches and a marriage song
With other pageants but this fair unknown
Had not a friend So being left alone
(Lycius was gone to summon all his kin)
And knowing surely she could never win
His foolish heart from its mad pompousness
She set herself high-thoughted how to dress
The misery in fit magnificence
She did so but 'tis doubtful how and whence
Came and who were her subtle servitors
About the halls and to and from the doors
There was a noise of wings till in short space
The glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched grace
A haunting music sole perhaps and lone
Supportress of the faery-roof made moan
Throughout as fearful the whole charm might fade
Fresh carved cedar mimicking a glade
Of palm and plantain met from either side
High in the midst in honour of the bride
Two palms and then two plantains and so on
From either side their stems branch'd one to one
All down the aisled place and beneath all
There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall
So canopied lay an untasted feast
Teeming with odours Lamia regal drest
Silently paced about and as she went
In pale contented sort of discontent
Mission'd her viewless servants to enrich
The fretted splendour of each nook and niche
Between the tree-stems marbled plain at first
Came jasper pannels then anon there burst
Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees
And with the larger wove in small intricacies
Approving all she faded at self-will
And shut the chamber up close hush'd and still
Complete and ready for the revels rude
When dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude
The day appear'd and all the gossip rout
O senseless Lycius Madman wherefore flout
The silent-blessing fate warm cloister'd hours
And show to common eyes these secret bowers
The herd approach'd each guest with busy brain
Arriving at the portal gaz'd amain
And enter'd marveling for they knew the street
Remember'd it from childhood all complete
Without a gap yet ne'er before had seen
That royal porch that high-built fair demesne
So in they hurried all maz'd curious and keen
Save one who look'd thereon with eye severe
And with calm-planted steps walk'd in austere
'Twas Apollonius something too he laugh'd
As though some knotty problem that had daft
His patient thought had now begun to thaw
And solve and melt—'twas just as he foresaw
He met within the murmurous vestibule
His young disciple 'Tis no common rule
Lycius said he for uninvited guest
To force himself upon you and infest
With an unbidden presence the bright throng
Of younger friends yet must I do this wrong
And you forgive me Lycius blush'd and led
The old man through the inner doors broad-spread
With reconciling words and courteous mien
Turning into sweet milk the sophist's spleen
Of wealthy lustre was the banquet-room
Fill'd with pervading brilliance and perfume
Before each lucid pannel fuming stood
A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood
Each by a sacred tripod held aloft
Whose slender feet wide-swerv'd upon the soft
Wool-woofed carpets fifty wreaths of smoke
From fifty censers their light voyage took
To the high roof still mimick'd as they rose
Along the mirror'd walls by twin-clouds odorous
Twelve sphered tables by silk seats insphered
High as the level of a man's breast rear'd
On libbard's paws upheld the heavy gold
Of cups and goblets and the store thrice told
Of Ceres' horn and in huge vessels wine
Come from the gloomy tun with merry shine
Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood
Each shrining in the midst the image of a God
When in an antichamber every guest
Had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press'd
By minist'ring slaves upon his hands and feet
And fragrant oils with ceremony meet
Pour'd on his hair they all mov'd to the feast
In white robes and themselves in order placed
Around the silken couches wondering
Whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring
Soft went the music the soft air along
While fluent Greek a vowel'd undersong
Kept up among the guests discoursing low
At first for scarcely was the wine at flow
But when the happy vintage touch'd their brains
Louder they talk and louder come the strains
Of powerful instruments—the gorgeous dyes
The space the splendour of the draperies
The roof of awful richness nectarous cheer
Beautiful slaves and Lamia's self appear
Now when the wine has done its rosy deed
And every soul from human trammels freed
No more so strange for merry wine sweet wine
Will make Elysian shades not too fair too divine
Soon was God Bacchus at meridian height
Flush'd were their cheeks and bright eyes double bright
Garlands of every green and every scent
From vales deflower'd or forest-trees branch-rent
In baskets of bright osier'd gold were brought
High as the handles heap'd to suit the thought
Of every guest that each as he did please
Might fancy-fit his brows silk-pillow'd at his ease
What wreath for Lamia What for Lycius
What for the sage old Apollonius
Upon her aching forehead be there hung
The leaves of willow and of adder's tongue
And for the youth quick let us strip for him
The thyrsus that his watching eyes may swim
Into forgetfulness and for the sage
Let spear-grass and the spiteful thistle wage
War on his temples Do not all charms fly
At the mere touch of cold philosophy
There was an awful rainbow once in heaven
We know her woof her texture she is given
In the dull catalogue of common things
Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings
Conquer all mysteries by rule and line
Empty the haunted air and gnomed mine—
Unweave a rainbow as it erewhile made
The tender-person'd Lamia melt into a shade
By her glad Lycius sitting in chief place
Scarce saw in all the room another face
Till checking his love trance a cup he took
Full brimm'd and opposite sent forth a look
'Cross the broad table to beseech a glance
From his old teacher's wrinkled countenance
And pledge him The bald-head philosopher
Had fix'd his eye without a twinkle or stir
Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride
Brow-beating her fair form and troubling her sweet pride
Lycius then press'd her hand with devout touch
As pale it lay upon the rosy couch
'Twas icy and the cold ran through his veins
Then sudden it grew hot and all the pains
Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart
Lamia what means this Wherefore dost thou start
Know'st thou that man Poor Lamia answer'd not
He gaz'd into her eyes and not a jot
Own'd they the lovelorn piteous appeal
More more he gaz'd his human senses reel
Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs
There was no recognition in those orbs
Lamia he cried—and no soft-toned reply
The many heard and the loud revelry
Grew hush the stately music no more breathes
The myrtle sicken'd in a thousand wreaths
By faint degrees voice lute and pleasure ceased
A deadly silence step by step increased
Until it seem'd a horrid presence there
And not a man but felt the terror in his hair
Lamia he shriek'd and nothing but the shriek
With its sad echo did the silence break
Begone foul dream he cried gazing again
In the bride's face where now no azure vein
Wander'd on fair-spaced temples no soft bloom
Misted the cheek no passion to illume
The deep-recessed vision—all was blight
Lamia no longer fair there sat a deadly white
Shut shut those juggling eyes thou ruthless man
Turn them aside wretch or the righteous ban
Of all the Gods whose dreadful images
Here represent their shadowy presences
May pierce them on the sudden with the thorn
Of painful blindness leaving thee forlorn
In trembling dotage to the feeblest fright
Of conscience for their long offended might
For all thine impious proud-heart sophistries
Unlawful magic and enticing lies
Corinthians look upon that gray-beard wretch
Mark how possess'd his lashless eyelids stretch
Around his demon eyes Corinthians see
My sweet bride withers at their potency
Fool said the sophist in an under-tone
Gruff with contempt which a death-nighing moan
From Lycius answer'd as heart-struck and lost
He sank supine beside the aching ghost
Fool Fool repeated he while his eyes still
Relented not nor mov'd from every ill
Of life have I preserv'd thee to this day
And shall I see thee made a serpent's prey
Then Lamia breath'd death breath the sophist's eye
Like a sharp spear went through her utterly
Keen cruel perceant stinging she as well
As her weak hand could any meaning tell
Motion'd him to be silent vainly so
He look'd and look'd again a level No
A Serpent echoed he no sooner said
Than with a frightful scream she vanished
And Lycius' arms were empty of delight
As were his limbs of life from that same night
On the high couch he lay his friends came round
Supported him no pulse or breath they found
And in its marriage robe the heavy body wound
